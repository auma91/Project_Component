Hello,
This is Group 1's (recitation group: 8) CSCI 3308: Software Development and Tools Project.
This is the projects overview: to create a web app in which one can search recipes, and get
step by step guides on how to go about making them.
The unique search feature takes into account a user's dietary restrictions (if applicable) to
assemble a list of recipes that are applicable to them.
The search tool even allows you to take into account what utensils you will need, thus
through the advanced search feature one may search recipes by ingredients and/or utensils they
have.
